<!-- Aviation History Section -->
<section id="history">
    <h2>Aviation History</h2>
    <p>The history of aviation dates back to the early 20th century with the pioneering work of the Wright brothers. In 1903, they achieved the first powered flight, forever changing the course of transportation.</p>

    <h3>Pioneer Era (1903-1914)</h3>
    <p>During this era, the Wright brothers achieved the first powered flight. Although aircraft technology was still primitive, their achievements laid the groundwork for future innovations.</p>

    <h3>World War I (1914-1918)</h3>
    <p>During World War I, aviation technology remained largely unchanged from the Wright brothers' designs. However, military forces began to use aircraft for reconnaissance and combat, marking the beginning of military aviation.</p>

    <h3>Post World War I</h3>
    <p>Following WWI, aviation technology advanced, and the commercial use of aircraft began. This laid the foundation for the rapid development that occurred during World War II.</p>

    <h3>World War II (1939-1945)</h3>
    <p>By WWII, aviation technology had advanced significantly. Fighters and bombers became critical to military strategy, and new technologies like jet engines were developed.</p>

    <h3>Post-World War II: Modern Aviation</h3>
    <p>After WWII, the aviation industry expanded rapidly. Aircraft technology continued to improve, with the introduction of jet engines making air travel faster and more efficient. Today, aviation plays a critical role in both military and commercial sectors.</p>

<!-- Principles of Flight Section -->
<section id="principles">
    <h2>Principles of Flight</h2>
    <p>Aviation relies on key principles that govern how an aircraft flies. Understanding these principles is essential for both pilots and engineers.</p>

    <h3>Bernoulli’s Theorem</h3>
    <p>Bernoulli’s Theorem explains that as the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure decreases. This principle is crucial in the generation of lift on an aircraft's wings.</p>

    <h3>Production of Lift</h3>
    <p>Lift is produced when the wings of an aircraft interact with the airflow. The shape of the wing, known as an aerofoil, causes the air above the wing to move faster than the air below it, resulting in higher pressure under the wing and creating lift.</p>

    <h3>Four Forces of Flight</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lift:</strong> The upward force that supports the aircraft.</li>
        <li><strong>Drag:</strong> The resistance the aircraft faces from air as it moves.</li>
        <li><strong>Thrust:</strong> The forward force that propels the aircraft.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight:</strong> The downward force caused by gravity.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Aircraft Controls Section -->
<section id="controls">
    <h2>Aircraft Controls</h2>
    <p>Modern aircraft are equipped with multiple controls to manage the flight. These controls are essential for maintaining the correct flight path and achieving desired movements.</p>

    <h3>Primary Control Surfaces</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rudder:</strong> Controlled by pedals, used for yaw control (left-right movement).</li>
        <li><strong>Elevator:</strong> Controls pitch (up-down movement) and is operated by the yoke or stick.</li>
        <li><strong>Ailerons:</strong> Control roll (tilting left or right) and are operated via the control stick.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Secondary Control Surfaces</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flaps:</strong> Used during takeoff and landing to increase lift and drag.</li>
        <li><strong>Slats:</strong> Help improve lift during slow flight.</li>
        <li><strong>Spoilers & Speed Brakes:</strong> Used to reduce lift and increase drag during descent.</li>
        <li><strong>Trim:</strong> Adjusts the control surfaces to maintain a stable flight without constant pilot input.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Cockpit Instruments Section -->
<section id="cockpit">
    <h2>Cockpit Instruments</h2>
    <p>The cockpit is filled with instruments that help the pilot monitor the aircraft's speed, altitude, orientation, and more. Here are some key instruments:</p>

    <h3>Airspeed Indicator (ASI)</h3>
    <p>Measures the aircraft's speed relative to the surrounding air.</p>

    <h3>Altimeter</h3>
    <p>Measures the aircraft's altitude by comparing the atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft to a standard reference pressure.</p>

    <h3>Artificial Horizon</h3>
    <p>Displays the aircraft's orientation relative to the Earth’s horizon, crucial for navigation in clouds or at night.</p>

    <h3>Turn and Slip Indicator</h3>
    <p>Shows whether the aircraft is turning or slipping (not turning properly), helping the  pilot maintain control.</p>
